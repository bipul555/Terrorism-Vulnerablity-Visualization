TERRORISM VULNERABILITY DATA VISUALIZATION FOR INDIAN STATES

Terrorism vulnerability is a crucial aspect of national security and is a major concern for many countries, including India. To effectively address and mitigate the threat of terrorism, it is important to clearly understand the vulnerability of different regions within the country toward terrorism. This visualization can be used to identify the states that are most at risk of terrorist attacks and understand the patterns and trends in terrorist activity across the country and develop effective strategies to counter terrorism. The data visualization includes a map of the Indian territory which is colour coded with different colours to indicate the severity of the threat, with red indicating the highest risk. This visualization can be further analyzed to identify areas of high vulnerability and target resources accordingly.The model will consider various factors that make a state more susceptible to terrorist attacks, including demographics, socioeconomic conditions, political instability, and past incidents of terrorism. To develop the model, we use data from the “The Global Terrorism Database” which includes various sources, including government reports, news articles, and academic research. We will employ data mining techniques to extract relevant data and identify the factors that significantly impact a state’s vulnerability to terrorism. By analyzing the resultant data, policymakers and security officials can identify the states that are most at risk and take steps to improve security and prevent future attacks. It can also help to inform public awareness campaigns and community preparedness efforts. Overall, terrorism vulnerability data visualization is a valuable tool for understanding and managing the threat of terrorism in India and with the potential to be further expanded for other countries, can be used to protect citizens and prevent terrorist attacks worldwide. The development of a terrorism vulnerability prediction model has numerous benefits for policymakers and security agencies in India. The model can help identify the areas where terrorist groups are likely to operate, allowing the authorities to take preventive measures. Additionally, the model can help to prioritize the allocation of resources to vulnerable areas to enhance the security infrastructure. Moreover, the model can serve as a tool to identify and address the underlying causes of terrorism, such as social and economic disparities. The project's methodology will involve several stages: data collection, cleaning, feature selection, and model development. The model is trained using the data from the "The Global Terrorism Database" by START.inc with the dedication of being used for national security. The model is built on four hidden layers of neural network with ADAM's Optimization, with the resultant prediction being plotted using the Folium Map Library. The data visualization obtained can be specifically used for analyzing previous and evading future terrorist attacks.
